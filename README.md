> ðŸ•º Code to show how we can easily add unit test into our Nuxt project

## Why we need this code sample

Nuxt already have sample for creating unit test for it's project with [Ava](https://github.com/avajs), you can read [here](https://nuxtjs.org/examples/testing). But in this sample, we will treat Nuxt project as a pure Vue project. We create unit test using [@vue/test-utils](https://vue-test-utils.vuejs.org/) because it have many sample for solving many case in real world project, and move from Ava to Jest as our unit test runner.

## Sample application

This project is based on [vue-realworld-example-app](https://github.com/gothinkster/vue-realworld-example-app)

Demo application available in: [https://vue-vuex-realworld.netlify.com/](https://vue-vuex-realworld.netlify.com/)
